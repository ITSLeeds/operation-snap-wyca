  abstract = {The paper investigates the occurrence of non-injury incidents among cyclists in the UK, seeking to (i) generate a rate that can be compared with injury rates, (ii) analyse factors affecting incident rates, and (iii) analyse factors affecting the impact of incidents on cyclists. We collected data on non-injury cycling `incidents' (near misses and other frightening and/or annoying incidents) from 1692 online diaries of cycle trip stages11A cycle trip stage being a part of a trip made by cycle; for example, cycling to the train station. and incidents, participants having signed up in advance for a specific day. Following data cleaning and coding, a dataset was created covering 1532 diary days and 3994 records of incidents occurring within the UK. Incident rates were calculated and compared to injury risks for cyclists. Cross-tabulation and regression were used to identify factors affecting incident rates and the effect an incident has on the cyclist. Frightening or annoying non-injury incidents, unlike slight injuries, are an everyday experience for most people cycling in the UK. For regular cyclists `very scary' incidents (rated as 3 on a 0--3 scale) are on average a weekly experience, with deliberate aggression experienced monthly. Per mile, non-injury incidents were more frequent for people making shorter and slower trips. People aged over 55 were at lower risk, as were those cycling at the weekend and outside the morning peak. Incidents that involved motor vehicles, especially those involving larger vehicles, were more frightening than those that did not. Near miss and other non-injury incidents are widespread in the UK and may have a substantial impact on cycling experience and uptake. Policy and research should initially target the most frightening types of incident, such as very close passes and incidents involving large vehicles. Further attention needs to be paid to the experiences of groups under-represented among cyclists, such as women making shorter trips.},

  abstract = {Replacing motor vehicle journeys with travel by foot and bicycle is recognised as a means to help achieve a range of health, environmental and economic objectives. Close passes - where a motor vehicle overtakes a cyclist with a minimal lateral clearance - have been identified as both a prominent safety concern and a barrier to increased uptake of cycling. Close passes are the most common type of on-road incident experienced by cyclists where a motor vehicle is involved and are also associated with collisions resulting in deaths and serious injuries. The current study builds on existing research investigating the underlying causes of close passes by examining responses from a sample of drivers to videos of close passes that were submitted by cyclists as driving complaints to an English county Police force. An online survey recorded the opinions of UK drivers (n~=~293) on the behaviour of the cyclist and driver featured in each of 8 video clips. The survey recorded participants' road use habits including the range of driving purposes engaged in (``driverXP''), their self-defined identity on a driver-cyclist spectrum, and their knowledge of recommended practice for bicycle road positioning. It also included the `Driving Anger eXpression' (DAX) scale, which scores tendencies towards different forms of anger expression while driving, including use of vehicle manoeuvres to express anger (``vehicleDAX''). Multiple regressions were used to determine the relationship between these independent variables, and participants' assessment of how risky the overtake was, and the extent to which the driver or cyclist were seen as liable for what happened. The level of liability apportioned to the cyclists featured in the clips was higher from drivers who were not cyclists themselves, compared with those who did cycle, and from drivers who scored higher on the vehicleDAX and driverXP measures (Identifies as cyclist {$\tau~$}=~-0.377, p~{$<$}.01), (driverXP {$\tau~$}=~0.209, p~{$<$}.01), (vehicleDAX {$\tau~$}=~0.113, p~{$<$}.05). Drivers with higher vehicleDAX scores showed lower levels of agreement with the statement ``the incident was dangerous'' in relation to the close pass clips. The liability apportioned to the cyclists featured was mediated by the drivers' cycling positional knowledge score ({$\Delta$}R2~=~0.139, p~{$<$}.001). This is the first time that naturalistic footage reported by cyclists to Police has been used to examine differing perceptions of the same close pass event. Findings show a need to share knowledge about cycling practice in order to help drivers navigate cycle traffic safely and considerately. This can inform road safety interventions that can contribute to safer cycling and driver behaviours that are more welcoming to existing and potential cyclists.},

  abstract = {A meta-analysis of studies of road accident reporting in official accident statistics made in 13 countries is described here. A rigorous comparison of reporting levels between countries is difficult because of differences in the definitions of reportable accidents, reporting levels, and data sources used to assess reporting levels. Based on 49 studies in 13 countries, it is concluded that reporting of injuries in official accident statistics is incomplete at all levels of injury severity. In rounded values, the mean reporting level in the countries included was found to be 95 percent for fatal injuries according to the 30-day rule, 70 percent for serious injuries (admitted to hospital), 25 percent for slight injuries (treated as outpatients), and 10 percent for very slight injuries (treated outside hospitals). Reporting levels vary substantially among countries, ranging from 21 to 88 percent for hospital-treated injuries. Reporting is highest for car occupants and lowest for cyclists. In particular, single-vehicle bicycle accidents are very rarely reported in official road accident statistics.},

The study of repeat victimization has evolved into that on crime hotspots and other forms of near repeat, and led to predictive policing. The F-B-I theory of crime concentration notes how some targets have characteristics that Flag them as attractive, offenders learn some targets or places are attractive which Boosts the chances of further crime, while the Interaction of potential offenders and suitable targets creates high crime locations. There is strong evidence that targeting crime concentrations with prevention resources can succeed but that it is not necessarily easy to implement appropriate tactics. Hence while there is great potential, much research remains to be undertaken in this rapidly evolving and important area.},

  abstract = {Whether for commuting or leisure, cycling is a growing transport mode in many countries. However, cycling is still perceived by many as a dangerous activity. Because the mode share of cycling tends to be low, serious incidents related to cycling are rare. Nevertheless, the fear of getting hit or falling while cycling hinders its expansion as a transport mode and it has been shown that focusing on killed and seriously injured casualties alone only touches the tip of the iceberg. Compared with reported incidents, there are many more incidents in which the person on the bike was destabilised or needed to take action to avoid a crash; so-called near misses. Because of their frequency, data related to near misses can provide much more information about the risk factors associated with cycling. The quality and coverage of this information depends on the method of data collection; from survey data to video data, and processing; from manual to automated. There remains a gap in our understanding of how best to identify and predict near misses and draw statistically significant conclusions, which may lead to better intervention measures and the creation of a safer environment for people on bikes. In this paper, we review the literature on cycling near misses, focusing on the data collection methods adopted, the scope and the risk factors identified. In doing so, we demonstrate that, while many near misses are a result of a combination of different factors that may or may not be transport-related, the current approach of tackling these factors may not be adequate for understanding the interconnections between all risk factors. To address this limitation, we highlight the potential of extracting data using a unified input (images/videos) relying on computer vision methods to automatically extract the wide spectrum of near miss risk factors, in addition to detecting the types of events associated with near misses.},

  abstract = {Though the percentage of people bicycling for transportation rose during the last decade, with an average increase in bicycle commuting of 47\% (Flusche, 2012), still only 1\% of all U.S. trips are made by bike (Flusche, 2010). Research suggests that people's concern regarding the risk of bicycling near traffic---namely the risk of being hit by a car---remain a significant barrier to widespread cycling. However, research has not disaggregated traffic risk to expose its many aspects and how they may affect bicyclists with differing skill levels, experiences, and behaviors. This study begins to address this gap in our understanding. Elaborating on results from an internet survey, this study examined various aspects of traffic risk among 406 potential and current bicyclists in the San Francisco Bay Area. The data indicate that perceived traffic risk negatively influences the decision to bicycle for potential and occasional bicyclists, although the influence decreases with cycling frequency. Additionally, cycling frequency seems to heighten awareness of traffic risk, particularly for cyclists who have experienced ``near misses'' or collisions. In particular, near misses were found to be (a) much more common than collisions and (b) more strongly associated than collisions with perceived traffic risk. The findings suggest that efforts targeting road user behaviors and roadway designs associated with these near misses could mitigate perceived and actual traffic risk for bicyclists, and thereby eventually help achieve higher cycling ridership.},
